# makefile-tutorial

This is an example of a project that builds its entire workflow into a Makefile. Contents:

- `data/` contains a .csv file with raw data.
- `R/` contains three scripts, one to clean the data, one to build two tables, and one to create a figure.
- `paper/` contains a LaTeX file that builds a PDF.

You can build the entire project by typing `make` into the command line or opening `makefile-tutorial.RProj` in RStudio and typing "ctrl+shift+B".
